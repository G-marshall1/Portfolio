            <div id="about">
                <p>Hi there! My name is Graham, and I am a passionate and driven programmer. I have always been
                    fascinated by technology and its ability to transform the world we live in. My journey in the field
                    of software development began when i was in my mid 20's, tinkering with computers and discovering
                    the joy of programming.</p>

                <p>Since then, I have pursued a career in computer engineering and have honed my skills in various areas
                    such as software development, computer architecture, networking, and security. I have a deep
                    understanding of programming languages such as html, css, and java script, and I am constantly
                    learning new ones to stay up to date with the latest technologies.

                <p>Over the years, I have worked on various projects, from designing and implementing complex software
                    systems to building and maintaining networks and security systems. I have also collaborated with
                    other engineers to design and implement innovative solutions to real-world problems.</p>

                <p>As a software developer, I am passionate about creating solutions that make a difference in people's
                    lives. I believe that technology should serve humanity and help us solve some of the world's most
                    pressing problems. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, attending tech conferences,
                    and contributing to open-source projects.</p>

                <p>I am excited about the future of software development and the endless possibilities it holds. I am
                    committed to staying on the cutting edge of technology and applying my knowledge and skills to make
                    a meaningful impact in the world.</p>
