# My Professional Portfolio

## Description

- I love creating new projects and decided the best way to share them easly would be to have them accessible through one home page!
- I chose to create a portfolio because it shows my artistic style and create a little bit of a fun option to show prospective employers. 
- I desided to create a  portfolio webpage that would use ease of use standard to allow anyone interested in my work to view it with little to no confusion.
- By making this page, I learned that a anchor and class element can easily be done wrong and mess up other items on the page. I also learned how to make a page my own and open up my creative eyes a little more.

## Installation

No installation needed since it is a landing page that can be viewed here https://g-marshall1.github.io/Portfolio/

## Usage
My portfolio webpage includes a title, navigation bar, banner, a header image, a breif "about me", interactive cards with text and images, and finally a contact option at the bottom of the page.


## Credits

No other members worked on this page besides myself, however I did view templets like this page to see specific useage cases on certain elements and classes.
